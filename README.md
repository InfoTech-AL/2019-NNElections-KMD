# More About Me

I have been following the crypto space since 2013. I bought my first bitcoin in 2015 and haven’t looked back...

I setup a mining rig, I setup some master nodes, I made a little money on BTC/ETH/LTC holdings, sold at the peak in DEC 2017 now I am looking to throw myself behind another promising platform for 2018!

I **know** the Komodo team will be successful and that is why I want to be part of this enterprise!

## What will you do for Komodo the coin, Komodo platform?

My experience is in distributed systems, grid services, QA, Windows / Linux
servers. I cannot link my professional profile because it would be against company
policy. However, I assure you I am dedicated to KMD success as a platform and the
team behind it. I am confident I will meet the leads and devs at some point in my
journey here. I have setup a Notary sever already, I have signed up for a dedicated wifi
setup so I can monitor, maintain and access the Node for any issues day and night.

Additionally, I have changed all my online presence to market Komodo and grow
the platform organically.
